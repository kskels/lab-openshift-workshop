This hands-on lab helps users to get familiar with Services and Routes.


If any issues encountered to copy contents into the terminal, you may optionally clone the repo and you will find all the snippets under `deploy/labs`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kskels/aspnet-core-app
```

### Create a Project

```bash
export OPENSHIFT_USERNAME=`oc whoami`
oc new-project ${OPENSHIFT_USERNAME}-proj4
```

### Services

Services provide internal load-balancing and service discovery across pods. See [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) for more information.

We will use a sample `.NET` application with Redis as a backend to explore services.

#### Deploy Redis

Create and save `redis-deployment.yaml` file with the following contents

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: aspnet-core-redis
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: aspnet-core-redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: aspnet-core-redis
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: registry.redhat.io/rhel8/redis-6
          name: aspnet-core-redis
          ports:
            - containerPort: 6379
```

Use the `oc` command line interface to create the object

```bash
oc create -f redis-deployment.yaml
```

To explose the service, create and save `redis-service.yaml` with the following contents

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: aspnet-core-redis
spec:
  ports:
    - name: 6379-tcp
      port: 6379
      targetPort: 6379
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: aspnet-core-redis
```

Use the `oc` command line interface to create the object

```bash
oc create -f redis-service.yaml
```

Explore objects created using `get` and `describe` commands

```bash
oc get all
oc describe service/aspnet-core-redis
```

### Routes

Routes make services accessible to clients outside the environment via real-world URLs. See [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) for more information.


#### Deploy .NET Application

Create and save `aspnet-core-app-deployment.yaml` file with the following contents

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: aspnet-core-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: aspnet-core-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: aspnet-core-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/kskels/aspnet-core-app:latest
          name: aspnet-core-app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

Use the `oc` command line interface to create the object

```bash
oc create -f aspnet-core-app-deployment.yaml
```

Create and save `aspnet-core-app-service.yaml` with the following contents

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: aspnet-core-app
spec:
  ports:
    - name: 8080-tcp
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: aspnet-core-app
``` 

Use the `oc` command line interface to create the object

```bash
oc create -f aspnet-core-app-service.yaml
```

Finally, create and save `aspnet-core-app-route.yaml` with the following contents

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
    app: aspnet-core-app
  name: aspnet-core-app
spec:
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  tls:
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
    termination: edge
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: aspnet-core-app
    weight: 100
```

Use the `oc` command line interface to create the object

```bash
oc create -f aspnet-core-app-route.yaml
```

Explore newly created objects including *Services* and *Routes*.

```bash
oc get all

oc describe service/aspnet-core-app
oc describe route/aspnet-core-app

oc get routes
```

You should now be able to access the application via the web browser.

Explore services from one of the `aspnet-core-app` *Pods*

```bash

oc get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
aspnet-core-app-6787fb8bcd-95d4d    1/1     Running   0          6m55s
aspnet-core-app-6787fb8bcd-ps6b7    1/1     Running   0          6m55s
aspnet-core-app-6787fb8bcd-s5ttw    1/1     Running   0          6m55s

oc exec -it aspnet-core-app-6787fb8bcd-95d4d -- bash
bash-4.4$ env |grep HOST

bash-4.4$ env |grep PORT
